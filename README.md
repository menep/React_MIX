## Motivation
I've created this app to practice routing with React Router.
Also, I've been trying to practice app design reduced to its bare bones.

## Practiced features:
- React Router
- JSX
- Functional and Class components
- Passing props
- Component styling
- Modifying state
- Handling events
- Lists and forms
- Passing unique ids as keys to a list element
- Ajax calls with Fetch API in React
