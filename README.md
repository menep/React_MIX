# React MIX
A collection of different apps made with React:

- Random Quote Machine (https://github.com/menep/React_RQM)
- Notepad (https://github.com/menep/React_notes)

## Motivation
I've created this app to practice routing with React Router.
I've found out that the apps that I've been creating to practice different React features would fit well when bundled together, and so this app was born.
Also, I've been trying to practice app design reduced to its bare bones.

## Practiced features:
- React Router
- JSX
- Functional and Class components
- Passing props
- Component styling
- Modifying state
- Handling events
- Lists and forms
- Passing unique ids as keys to a list element
- Ajax calls with Fetch API in React

## How to install
